This repository contains a simple web interface that allows users to input a Discord invite link and retrieve information about the associated server.

## Features

- Retrieves various details about the Discord server, including server name, description, icon, banner, splash, invite type, expiration date, guild ID, channel ID, channel type, channel name, premium subscription count, NSFW status, NSFW level, vanity URL code, verification level, and server features.
- Allows users to copy the retrieved information to the clipboard for easy sharing or reference.

## Usage

To use the Discord Invite Checker:

1. Open the [website](https://thatsinewave.github.io/Discord-Invite-Checker/) in a web browser.
2. Input a Discord invite link into the provided text field.
3. Click on the "Get Invite Info" button.
4. View the retrieved information about the Discord server.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the web interface.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the web interface.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for fetching Discord invite information and rendering it on the web page.

## How It Works

The web interface utilizes the Discord API to fetch information about the provided invite link. It then dynamically renders the retrieved information on the web page using JavaScript.
