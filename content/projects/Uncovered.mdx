Uncovered is a simple web application designed to perform domain/IP scans. It retrieves information about a provided domain or IP address, utilizing the IP-API service for IP information. Please note that the WHOIS lookup feature is not fully implemented at the moment but will be integrated in the future.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter a domain name or IP address into the input field.
3. Click on the "Scan" button.
4. View the retrieved information about the domain or IP address.

## Features

- Retrieves IP information using the IP-API service.
- Displays IP-API information such as continent, country, region, city, etc.
- Placeholder error message for WHOIS lookup (will be fully implemented in the future).

## Credits

- IP-API: Provides IP information retrieval.
- WHOIS-JS: Library for WHOIS lookup (to be fully implemented in the future).
