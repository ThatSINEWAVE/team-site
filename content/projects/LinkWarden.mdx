## Getting Started

Before you can use the bot, you'll need to set it up with your Discord server and configure it with your API keys.

### Prerequisites

- A Discord account with administrative privileges on your server.
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- API keys for VirusTotal and urlscan.io (available from their respective websites).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `config.py` file in the same directory as your bot script ( or use the premade 'config.py' file ), and add your Discord Bot Token, VirusTotal API Key, URLScan.io API Key, guild ID(s), Moderator Role ID, and the ID of the channel where you want the output of auto link scans to go in the following format:

```python
TOKEN = 'your_discord_bot_token_here'
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key_here'
URLSCAN_API_KEY = 'your_urlscan_io_api_key_here'
guild_ids = [your_guild_id_here]
SCAN_CHANNEL_ID = CHANNEL_WHERE_SCANS_SHOULD_GO
ALLOWED_ROLE_IDS = [MOD_ROLE_ID_GOES_HERE]
```
4. Run `main.py`

### Dependencies

This bot requires the following Python packages:
- discord.py
- py-cord
- requests
- python-whois
These can be installed using pip:

```python
pip install discord.py requests python-whois py-cord
```

## Usage

The bot is straightforward to use with a simple command structure. It supports the following command:

### Command Structure

`/checklink [LINK] [MODE]`

- **Simple Mode**: Provides a user-friendly summary including the safety status of the link, WHOIS domain registration summary, and a link to the urlscan.io report.

`/checklink https://example.com simple`

- **Detailed Mode**: Offers an exhaustive report with vendor-specific ratings from VirusTotal, detailed WHOIS information, and a comprehensive security report from urlscan.io.

`/checklink https://example.com detailed`

- **History**: Outputs a simple list of past links that were used for scans and keeps track of how many times each link was seen.

`/checklhistory`

### Modes Explained

## Future Enhancements

- **Dashboard Integration**: Develop a web-based dashboard that provides an overview of past scans, including detailed results and statistics. This dashboard will offer insights into the types of links shared within the server and the bot's effectiveness in identifying threats, enhancing transparency and trust in the bot's capabilities.
- **Additional Scanning Integrations**: Expand the bot's scanning capabilities by integrating additional security tools and services. This expansion will provide more comprehensive coverage and protection against a wider range of online threats.
- **User Feedback System**: Implement a system for users to provide feedback on scan results, such as reporting false positives or missed threats. This feedback loop will help improve the bot's accuracy and effectiveness over time.
