This repository houses a curated collection of DNS filter lists, accumulated over several years. These lists are designed to enhance network security and efficiency by blocking unwanted or harmful domains.

## Contents

The repository contains multiple DNS filter lists, each tailored for different use cases or threats. These lists may include, but are not limited to, filters for:

- Advertisements
- Tracking domains
- Malware and phishing sites
- Content filters for family-safe browsing

## Disclaimer

**Please note that the filter lists included in this repository are not originally created by me. They have been collected from various public sources over the years and are compiled here for convenience.**
