Welcome to the GuardianWatch! This bot is your go-to tool for gathering and organizing information about Discord server members efficiently. Written entirely in Python and leveraging the power of Discord's Bot API along with the Google Sheets API, this bot offers versatility and ease of use across its three distinct modes: gsheets-mode, csv-mode, and combined-mode.

## Features

GSheets Mode: Automatically compiles a comprehensive list of user information at bot startup and sends it directly to your specified Google Sheets page.
CSV Mode: Utilizes the /inspect command to gather user information on-demand and outputs it as a CSV file directly in the chat.
Combined Mode: Merges the functionalities of GSheets and CSV modes, allowing the /inspect command to target either output format based on provided arguments (csv or gsheets).
Each mode operates as a separate Python file, giving you the flexibility to choose the version that best suits your needs.

## Information Collected

Currently, the bot collects the following information about each user:
- Username
- Discord ID
- Nickname
- Profile Picture URL
- Roles

## Future Enhancements

We're constantly looking to expand the bot's capabilities. Planned future updates include additional user details such as:
- Join Date
- Account Age
- Total Messages Sent
- Last Message Sent in the Server
- Getting Started
